# Lesson 8: Object Detection

## Definitions
**Differentiable Layer**: Stacks of differentiable non-linear functions with lots of parameters solve nearly any predictive modeling problem

## Dataset
- Pascal 

## Libraries
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Transfer Layer
- Replace last layer
- Fine-Tune new layers
- Fine-tune more layers (optional)

## Object Detection
- Multiple things to classify in an image (segmentation)
- Bounding boxes around what we are classifying
- Classify the largest object in an image
- Find the location of the largest object at each image
