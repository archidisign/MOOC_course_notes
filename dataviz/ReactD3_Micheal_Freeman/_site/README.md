# React for D3 Users
These resources are designed to teach D3 users how to scaffold their projects using React. To see the hosted versions of these demos/exercises, visit [this page](http://mfviz.com/react-d3). **Demos** are completed demonstrations of certain techniques, while **exercises** contain instructions for building a particular page (a `*_solution.js` file is also included). See accompanying slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2Wz56-3FfZpwi5gEuppMWQmotj1MoTYXCqbkKm4aAc/edit?usp=sharing).

These resources were developed for a workshop at
<a href="http://www.openvisconf.com/" target="_blank">OpenvisConf 2018</a>. Built by <a href="http://mfviz.com" target="_blank">Michael Freeman</a>.

## Prerequisites
This workshop assumes that you are comfortable building visualizations with D3 and using underlying programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). **No prior React knowledge** is assumed or needed. The only technology you will need on your machine is the ability to **run a local server**. Any local server is fine, but in case you don't have one installed, here are a few suggestions:


- Use Python's [`SimpleHTTPServer`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) (for Python 2) or [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) (for Python 3)
- The `npm` package [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
- Download a local server program such as [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (Mac) or [WAMP])( (Windows))

Additionally, you may find it helpful to install the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) Chrome Extension for debugging React.

## Getting Started
To use these materials, you should `fork` and `clone` this repository to your machine (if you don't have a GitHub account, you can simply **download** them to your machine). 

Then, I suggest you start running a local server in the _root_ of the repository to view the set of available exercises and their descriptions ( you can see them online [here](http://mfviz.com/react-d3)). Then, you can **explore** the code for any given repository `*-demo`, or work through the instructions in any exercise (repos with the suffix `-exercise`). 

## Feedback + Additional Resources
