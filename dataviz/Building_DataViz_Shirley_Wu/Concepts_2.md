# Concepts Data Visualization Introduction

## 2 Categories of DataViz
- Expository
	- Static dataset, explore data for story, communicate story for audience
	- User: News, media
	- Example: movies
- Exploratory:
	- Dynamic dataset, interview stakeholders, build tool for stakeholders to explore the data
	- User: Scientific visualizations, internal tools, Netflix, Airbnb, etc

## Data Exploration
- Chart Types & Vega-Lite
	- Bar Chart: Categorical or quantitative data to compare
	- Histogram: distribution
	- ScatterPlot: Correlation
	- Line chart: Time series, see relation between 2 variables
	- Tree: For hierarchy
	- Node-link diagram: For connections
	- Map: Time and Space
		- Choropleths: Show regional patterns
	- Pie Chart: Probabilities
- Vega-Lite: show a grammar of interactive graphics
- Observable: discover insights faster and communicate more effectively with interactive notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and exploration.
	- Using Modules in Observable
- Marks & Channels:
	- Marks are where you map an individual or aggregated data element to a geographic element. So map individual or aggregated data elements to marks and then map data attributes to channels.
	- channels are anything from color, shape, tilt, size. Think of them as how I map my attributes, so dates or metascores, etc.
- Remix and Overlay: "You don't always need to start from scratch."

## Gestalt Laws of Grouping
1. Similarity
2. Proximity
3. Closure
4. Good continuation
5. Common fate
6. Good form

## D3
- Shapes
- Layouts

## Final Touch
- Readability
- Aesthetics
- Interaction
