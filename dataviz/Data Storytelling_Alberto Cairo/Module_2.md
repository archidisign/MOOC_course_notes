# Module 2

## INZight for data exploration
- Can install or use web version [here](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/)
- Can go on the course website to get tutorials and dataset
- It is a great tool to do exploration data

Example: Schools in Miami-Dade County

## Using histograms and seeing summary statistics
1. Plot the distribution of the data (school grade from A-F)
2. Plot the distribution of the data per interesting feature (reading level)
	- Split by qunantile
	- Look at mean, standard derivation, sample size

## Scatter plots. Trends and outliers
Here, we are look at the relation between values
- Positive or negative correlation (careful on the variable direction)
- Regression line
- Remove outliers from scatter plot

## Using maps
_Note_: This section created a map using INZight
