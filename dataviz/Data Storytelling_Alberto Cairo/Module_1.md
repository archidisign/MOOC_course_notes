To get more insight than just what you see.
- Exploration
- Discovery

Be creative!

## Elements of Visualization
- Container: The framework of the chart (scale, legend)
- Content: The visual encoding -> the numbers, data
- Annotation: The text that puts the data in context

### Identify Encodings
- Focus on your purpose and build the style/structure around that
	- Is the goal to compare number of arrival from USA and Canada -> Bar Chart
	- Show the proportion of arrivals per country -> Pie Chart
- Can play with color intensity, size (of the curve, the buble, etc.)
- Example shown: Map, curve plot, buble chart
