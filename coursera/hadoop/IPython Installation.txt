Install IPython / Setup PySpark on the Cloudera VM
From the top left menu, Open a terminal: Applications => System Tools => Terminal

Type:
> sudo easy_install ipython==1.2.1

Hit enter, administrator password is cloudera.

Launch pyspark with IPython
Every time you need to open the pyspark shell, open a terminal and type:
> PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython pyspark
Hit enter, after the startup logs, you should see the pyspark console.


Check version
To make sure that PySpark started correctly, print out the version by typing in the PySpark IPython terminal:
sc.version

Verify that the output is:
u'1.3.0'


Python resources
This module requires a basic knowledge of Python to perform the programming assignments.

I recommend to take the interactive tutorial at: http://learnpython.org, the "Learn the basics" section should be enough.

Then if you want to learn more about Python, even if not necessary for this class, you can check the Coursera class:
