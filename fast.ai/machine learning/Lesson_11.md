# Lesson 11: Embedding

## Review math behind Naive Bayes
- SGD
	- Optimizing multi-layer functions
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- NBSVM++

## Loss
- Cross-entropy

## Feature Engineering
- Features using n-gram
- Bigram as baseline model

## Embeddings
- Pretend it is linear
- Embedding means make a multiplication by a one hot encoded matrix faster by replacing it with a simple array lookup.

### Usage
1. Categorical variables in tabular data
2. NLP
