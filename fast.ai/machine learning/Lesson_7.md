# Lesson 7: Random Forest and Gradient Descent

## Cython library
- To get the same speed as C code

## Gradient Descent/Boosting Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net Lasso

## Validation Set
- Compare if your set is big enough:
	- Train your model 5 times with the same hyperparameters
	- Compare the mean and standard deviation

## Random Forest
- Function to find best Split
- Go deeper (inception)

_Note_: Lesson 5-7 build a Random Forest from scratch
